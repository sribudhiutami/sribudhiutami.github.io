### My research
My research interests and expertise span fields including geochemistry, volcano/igneous petrology, and geodynamics. My site volcanoes cover Indonesia (Kelud, Ijen) and Chile (Osorno, Villarrica). 

In my research, I use combined petrological-geochemical-volcanological approach to decipher the mechanisms and timescales of pre-eruptive/syn-eruptive processes that leads to volcanic eruptions, from mineral- to outcrop-scale. 

I also model timescales and rates using zoned "mineral clocks" (diffusion chronometry) to estimate the time taken from the incipient point of a given pre-eruptive process to eruption. Then I relate these timescales to volcanic unrest signals, and to physical parameters such as viscosity. I also work on projects relating magmatic systems and timescales to subduction zone geodynamics.

Finally, I conduct phase equilibrium experiments to constrain magmatic storage conditions. I am currently developing experimental setups for diffusion experiments. 

If you are interested in my work and would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact me!
