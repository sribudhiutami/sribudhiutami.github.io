### My research
I am interested in diffusion chronometry, volcano petrology, hazard reduction, and geodynamics. My site volcanoes cover Indonesia (Kelud, Ijen) and Chile (Osorno, Villarrica). My research toolkit involves using a combined petrological and geochemical study to decipher evidence for processes that leads to volcanic eruptions. I also use diffusion chronometry i.e. "mineral clocks" to estimate the timescales from eruption process initiation to eruption, and experiments to constrain magmatic storage conditions by simulating high temperature/pressure. I work primarily on arc volcanoes, but open for collaborations. Please do not hesitate to contact me!
