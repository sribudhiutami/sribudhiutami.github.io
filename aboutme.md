My name is Sri Budhi Utami, or Sri (pronouns: she/her). I am an FNRS postdoctoral fellow at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium. 

### My research
I am interested in diffusion chronometry, volcano petrology, hazard reduction, and geodynamics. My site volcanoes cover Indonesia (Kelud, Ijen) and Chile (Osorno, Villarrica). My research toolkit involves using a combined textural study and geochemistry to decipher processes that leads to volcanic eruptions.
