### My research
My research span fields including diffusion chronometry, volcano/igneous petrology, volcano science, and geodynamics. My site volcanoes cover Indonesia (Kelud, Ijen) and Chile (Osorno, Villarrica). 

My research toolkit involves using a combined petrological and geochemical study to decipher evidence for processes that leads to volcanic eruptions. I also use diffusion chronometry i.e. "mineral clocks" to estimate the timescales from eruption process initiation to eruption, and phase equilibrium experiments to constrain magmatic storage conditions by simulating high temperature/pressure. Currently I also work on projects relating magmatic systems and timescales to subduction zone geodynamics.

If you are interested in my work and would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact me!
