### My research
My research interests and expertise span fields including geochemistry, volcano/igneous petrology, and geodynamics. My site volcanoes cover Indonesia (Kelud, Ijen) and Chile (Osorno, Villarrica). 

In my research, I use combined petrological, geochemical, and volcanological approach to decipher processes that leads to volcanic eruptions from the mineral records to outcrop scale. I also model timescales and rates using zoned "mineral clocks" (diffusion chronometry) to estimate the time it takes from the incipient point of the pre-eruptive process to eruption. Then I relate these timescales to volcanic unrest and to physical parameters such as effective viscosity. Finally, I conduct phase equilibrium experiments to constrain magmatic storage conditions, and currently developing setups for diffusion experiments. Currently I also work on projects relating magmatic systems and timescales to subduction zone geodynamics.

If you are interested in my work and would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact me!
