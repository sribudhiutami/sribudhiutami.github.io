### My research
My research interests and expertise span fields including geochemistry, volcano/igneous petrology, and geodynamics. My site volcanoes cover Indonesia (Kelud, Ijen) and Chile (Osorno, Villarrica). 

In my research, I use a combined petrological and geochemical approach to decipher processes that leads to volcanic eruptions from the rock and mineral records. I also model timescales using "mineral clocks" (diffusion chronometry) to estimate the timescales from eruption process initiation to eruption, and phase equilibrium experiments to constrain magmatic storage conditions by simulating high temperature/pressure. Currently I also work on projects relating magmatic systems and timescales to subduction zone geodynamics.

If you are interested in my work and would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact me!
