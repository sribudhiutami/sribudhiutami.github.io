### My research
My research interests and expertise span fields including geochemistry, volcano/igneous petrology, and geodynamics. My site volcanoes cover Indonesia (Kelud, Ijen) and Chile (Osorno, Villarrica). 

In my research, I use a combined petrological, geochemical, and volcanological approach to decipher processes that leads to volcanic eruptions from the rock and mineral records. I also model timescales and rates using zoned "mineral clocks" (diffusion chronometry) to estimate the time it takes from initiation of the triggering process to eruption. Finally I conduct phase equilibrium experiments to constrain magmatic storage conditions, and currently developing setups for diffusion experiments. Currently I also work on projects relating magmatic systems and timescales to subduction zone geodynamics.

If you are interested in my work and would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact me!
